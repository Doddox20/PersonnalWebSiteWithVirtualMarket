# PersonnalWebSiteWithVirtualMarket

Website simulating a shopping site, allowing you to register products and put them in a
shopping cart, while being connected with a session system.

Website developed in PHP with Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Ajax.
MySql base, using PhpMyAdmin, for the web server, initially I used uWamp which
allows you to have Wamp locally on a USB key.
This moment i don't have the database code, i put it later.
